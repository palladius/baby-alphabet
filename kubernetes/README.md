Here I'm going to document the steps which are needed to make this work.

Note that DEV and PROD werre created last year with some commands I cant remember.

The SKAFF version was created on 2021-12-26 (on a train to Italy, I know!) to do it
from scratch. I have a vague presentiment (TM) that this is gonna require some
custom DNS and IP LB mapping until KPT is mature enough to obsolete this and automagcially `terraform` this (kubeform?).

This blurb is to remind myself that for SKAFF I should document and put on CLI what I do.
