* P1 remove private pics and put random ones
* P2 add an ENV var which is not necessarily alphabet/ to try different alphabets :) Default could be "vanilla" which ahs children safe stuff. And
  I could have `carlesso` with private stuff. This wiould make it easier for 3rd people (eg Jeeremy) to add their own folder.
