<h1>AJ Alphabet</h1>

<p>Saturday 9 January 2021, my wife told me my son Alessandro is a bit late in
reading any letter of th alphabet and she uirged e to do something about it.
I said: 'tranquilla, leave it with me' (which is British for <i>hold my beer</i>). 
24 hours later this application was built.
