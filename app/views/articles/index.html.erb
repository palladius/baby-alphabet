<h1>ðŸ”¤ AJ Alphabet</h1>

<p>On Saturday 9 January 2021, my wife told me my son Alessandro is a bit late in
reading any letter of th alphabet and she uirged e to do something about it.
I said: 'tranquilla, leave it with me' (which is British for <i>hold my beer</i>). 
24 hours later this application was built. 
</p>

<p>Please see <a href="/alfabeto?predilige=portrait&cells_per_row=6" >my wife's favorite page</a>.
</p>

<p>Note that if ENV[ALPHABET_DEFAULT_FOLDER] has been set correctly your default directory 
for this application should be: 
<span class="alphabet-directory"><b>
    <%= ENV["ALPHABET_DEFAULT_FOLDER"] %>/
</b></span>.
</p>

<p>And in fact, <tt>AlphabetPicture.image_base</tt> =    <%= AlphabetPicture.image_base %>.</p>

<h2>Pictures</h2>
<p>Some pictures in '<%= $image_base %>' folder..</p>

<% @alphabet_photo_paths.each do |paz|  %>
    <%= alphabet_image_tag(paz, :height => 50 ) %>
<% end %>
